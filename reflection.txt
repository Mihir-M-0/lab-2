The lab today was pretty challenging. The hardest part was using the VSCode and pytest for the first time. The syntax was pretty confusing. I didn't know how to create a Jupyter notebook to run my code and I also didn't know how to resolve the pytest errors. It was only until after asking for help did I realize there was a test_assignment.py tab to help me look for it. I also didn't know what quantiles and linear interpolation was so I had to search that up. Implementing things weren't hard but just understanding the syntax was difficult. It was also my first time seeing things like raising Value and Type errors.
